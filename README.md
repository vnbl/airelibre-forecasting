## Training
### 0. Getting raw data for training
Run the code located at `notebooks/1.0-fcg-initial-data-exploration.ipynb`. It is recommended that for training you retrieve at least one year of data.

Data will be stored at `data/raw/airelibre_data.csv`

Config parameters:
* start_date=datetime(YYYY, mm, dd)
* end_date=datetime(YYYY, mm, dd)

### 1. Preparing the dataset


### 2. Building the features


### 3. Training
